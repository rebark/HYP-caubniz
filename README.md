The design project is available in the design folder. Mind that the html file doesn't work in google chrome, but it works in firefox.



## Improvements from Design Project

We implemented clickable breadcrumbs, eliminating the "go back to category" links that were displayed in the mock up. Moreover we handled the go back link dynamically, so that they adapt to the user navigation.
