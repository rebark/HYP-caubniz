## Changes and improvements from Design Project

We implemented clickable breadcrumbs, eliminating the "go back to category" links that were displayed in the mock up. We also handled the go back link dynamically, so that they adapt to the user navigation. <br>
We have implemented the FAQs also for the "Smartphone and Tablet for TIMvision" assistance service page, with respect to the mockup version of the page which had only the description section. <br><br>
The categories which didn't have any implemented SL, Assistance Services or Devices reachable from that page, were kept as non clickable in the final implementation (e.g. Assistance Services -> Line Management).<br><br>
In the P-IDM diagram, we interpreted Description and FAQs of Assistance Services as separated pages even if they are loaded at the same time when the user access to the page. We did this choice because visually, from the user perspective, they can be considered different pages and also by making this choice we could specify in the diagram that the introductory page is the description section.
